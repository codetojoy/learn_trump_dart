### summary

* are the cards in your hand or the cards played for a trick?
    - this is more about game-play than business logic re: ranking
    - has implications about what it means to have a leading suit

### done

* leading suit implies a card was played, so it has to be accounted for 
* print sorted cards in descending order
* confirm that leading suit is ranked by non-trump ranking
* sort so that cards with equal value have a secondary-sort by suit
